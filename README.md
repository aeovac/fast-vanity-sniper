**Why Rust?**

- Best websocket implementaions (rustls, fastwebsockets by deno, ...) with low latency and pretty good performance
- It Fast and low level


At first I wanted to use Elixir, because Discord's websocket gateway is also made in Elixir (for obvious reasons) and natively supports etf encoding
